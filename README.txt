------ Welcome on Immo WF3 Agency --------

A real estate agency.

This project was made for school by a 4 web developers Junior group. Our professors wanted us to organize our work on an Agile method.
This way of working was very pleasant. 
We had 8 days to work on it and based on our client's demanding we achieved to put 6 on 7 fonctionnalities he asked us for.
The missing fonctionnality was a statistics page.

I putted in the folder our Power Point presentation (written in french).

Obvioulsy, the website is in french too, but don't be afraid, try it yourself!

/!\ Before going ahead, you need to check if you have a local server (i personnaly work on Laragon) + Symfony framework.

1/ Open the project in your text editor then open a new terminal.
2/ Enter the project which is in Agency file so you have to write in your command line " cd Agency ".
3/ After that, you can add "symfony serve"
4/ Open it in your navigator! 
5/ Don't lose your time, susbscribe and connect to see our homes exclusivities! 
	OR, if you want to login as an Admin, you just have to change your role in the database!

Enjoy!
