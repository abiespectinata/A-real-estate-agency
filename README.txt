------ Welcome on Immo WF3 Agency --------

A real estate agency.

This project was made for school by a 4 persons web developers Junior group. Our professors wanted us to organize our work on Agile method.
This way of working was pleasant, except our client was a little bit demanding. 
But anyway, we had 8 days to work on it and we achieved to put 6 on 7 fonctionnalities.
The missing fonctionnality was a statistics page.

I will put in the file our Power Point presentation (written in french).

Obvioulsy, the website is in french too, but don't be afraid, try it yourself!

/!\ Before going ahead, you need to check if you have a local server (i personnaly work on Laragon) + Symfony framework.

1/ Open the project in your text editor then open a new terminal.
2/ Enter the project which is in Agency file so you'll have to write in your command line " cd Agency ".
3/ After that, you can write "symfony serve"
4/ Open it in your navigator! 
5/ Don't lose your time, susbscribe and connect to see our homes exclusivities! 
	OR, if you want to login as an Admin, you just have to go change your role in the database!

Enjoy!
